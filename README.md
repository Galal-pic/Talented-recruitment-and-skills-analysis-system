<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Abstract

This project introduces an innovative approach to revolutionizing the employment process by integrating advanced technology and insightful analysis. Our focus is on the development of bracelets that function as a conduit between job seekers and their ideal career opportunities. Through meticulous scanning and analysis of numerous job descriptions, we extract essential skills crucial for various positions, serving as the foundation for success in the competitive job market. 

Utilizing sophisticated algorithms, our bracelets seamlessly match these extracted skills with those showcased in job seekers' CVs, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of alignment between candidate skills and market demands. Additionally, our system identifies any skill gaps or deficiencies in the candidate's profile, offering personalized recommendations and advertisements for skill enhancement or training opportunities. 

Beyond aiding job seekers, our platform streamlines the recruitment process for companies by providing them with tailored CVs that precisely align with their job descriptions, thereby enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in hiring practices.

## Introduction

In this project, we address the needs of two key stakeholders: 
- **Job seeker**, who seeks roles aligned with their skills and desires insights into areas for skill enhancement to secure their dream job
- **Recruiter**, who aims to procure the most fitting CVs by defining job requirements and essential skills. We recommend the most suitable CVs and facilitate effective communication channels between recruiters and potential candidates.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Usage
- If you are looking for a job, you can submit your CV, and we will show you which jobs are suitable for you and what skills are required for them. Through our analysis of over 15,000 job descriptions, we can share with you the skills most frequently needed for the job you want. We will also offer you job opportunities that you can register for directly.
